## Introduction

In this section we want to describe our process to create the User Stories and tasks in the ClubHouse board.

### User Story cards

Each card in ClubHouse is called User Story (Story), it can be:

* Feature
* Chore
* Bug

`Chores` are the things you have to do that don’t actually change your product.

Examples include paying down technical debt, improving test coverage, upgrading library dependencies, research, devops tasks like spinning up new servers, database maintenance, operational tasks, writing scripts to automate those tasks, etc.

We like to create the `Feature type` as SMART tasks instead of INVEST stories, so we can move short but meaningful tasks through the Clubhouse board.
Each Feature task is linked to an Epic card, but we create this Epic card as an INVEST Story.

Pay attention to the SMART meaning so you can create a nice described/sized task:

* Specific: The goal should target a specific area of improvement or answer a specific need.
* Measurable: The goal must be quantifiable, or at least allow for measurable progress.
* Attainable: The goal should be realistic, based on available resources and existing constraints.
* Relevant: The goal should align with other business objectives to be considered worthwhile.
* Time-bound: The goal must have a deadline or defined end.

Be sure not to create a task such as "create a input field", or "create an API", because it may be too small and you may miss the point of what you are developing.

All SMART tasks should be linked to a User Story, which should be properly detailed with its goal (it can be written using the User Story pattern), Acceptance criteria, and BDD if necessary.

### Epic cards

The type Epic will be considered INVEST Stories to us.

You can follow the script in this link to create the User Story text and the BDD scenarios: https://forrest.netlify.com/#/

Pay attention to what INVEST stands for:

* Independent (of all others)
* Negotiable (not a specific contract for features)
* Valuable (or vertical)
* Estimable (to a good approximation)
* Small (so you won't take months to complete a single User Story)
* Testable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)
